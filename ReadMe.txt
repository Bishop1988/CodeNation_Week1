Hello, I used the npm package "prompt" to take user input on one the first challange in the ifElseSwitch.js file. This is why there is a package.json file. 

link to package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/prompt

If you would like me to refactor my code so it doesnt use this package please let me know.

cheers
